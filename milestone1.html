       <h1>Video games</h1>     
    </header>
    <ul>
    <li><p>The purpose of this site is to show the benefits that come about with being involved in the video game community. Whether it be as a professional video gamer playing for esports teams or a game designer behind the scenes. I want to address the concern many parents and others have about video games saying that they are bad and can cause problems.</p></li>
   
    <li><p>My intended audience would be concerned parents and anyone who is anti video games because they believe they are harmful to one's mental and physical health</p></li>
    
    <li><p>My site will include content such as the benefits of video games and how they can help one's mental health, as well as, create job opportunities. Two related sites would be <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/02/video-game">apa.org</a> and <a href="https://www.gamedesigning.org/why-video-games-are-good/">gamedesigning.org</a>which are both sites that contain information about many topics, but have articles addressing what I would like to cover on my webpage. My site will address the general view that I believe a lot of people have about video games which is that they are unhealthy and cause problems. Then it will give basic information against those views.</p></li>

	      <li>Personal Background:
                <br>Hello, my name is Tyler McHugh and I have been programming since late 2009 with mostly java and c++. I spend most of my free time playing video games, hiking, or just spending time with family and friends. I play video games competitively on a professional level and I enjoy it very much. I have done so in such games as PUBG, Apex Legends, and currently working on Valorant. 
              </li>
              <li>Academic Background:
                <br>I started taking programming courses in Highschool with AP computer science in which I received an award for being top of my class. I have attended Wingate University for a semester in which I took a java programming course. After that I transfered to UNCC where I continued my computer science degree for several years before some unfortunate circumstances made me have to halt my academic career for the time being. After a period of time I enrolled in CPCC to finish my degree.
              </li>
              <li>Courses I'm Taking, & Why:               
                <ul>
                  <li>Web110 - I am taking because of course it is required for my degree, but I would also like to learn as much as I can about web fundamentals</li>
                  <li>CSC 154 - I am also taking because this course is also required for my degree, but I would love to learn as much as I can about software development.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Something To Remember Me By:
                <br>My name is Tyler and I play video games on a professional level.
